## About Me
Hello, I am Sarah Robinson, CS student at UNC Greensboro. The coding language that I have the most experience with is Java.  I am looking forward to expanding my knowledge by learning Spring Boot along with other technologies to help strengthen my development skills. GitHub will be one of many useful tools that will help me colaborate and create applications that are useful and meaningful. When I am not studying you can normally find me baking, or playing with one of our three dogs. Carpe Diem!

## My CSC340 Goals
In this class I hope to gain more experience with Spring Boot and other techonologies that will help me strengthen my development skills. Additionally, I hope to gain experience collaborating with others which will better prepare me for future employment opportunities and most importantly have some fun learning to build web applications!
